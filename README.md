# diabetes_prediction_dataset
🩺 Diabetes Prediction Dataset
This dataset is intended for binary classification tasks to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes or not, based on various health-related features.

📁 Dataset Information
Filename: diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv

Each row in the dataset represents data collected from an individual, including medical and demographic attributes.

🔑 Target Variable
diabetes (0: No Diabetes, 1: Diabetes)

🧬 Features
Column Name	Description	Data Type
gender	Gender of the individual (Male, Female, Other)	Categorical
age	Age in years	Continuous
hypertension	Whether the patient has hypertension (0 or 1)	Binary
heart_disease	Whether the patient has heart disease (0 or 1)	Binary
smoking_history	Smoking history (never, former, current, etc.)	Categorical
bmi	Body Mass Index	Continuous
HbA1c_level	Hemoglobin A1c level	Continuous
blood_glucose_level	Blood glucose level (mg/dL)	Continuous
diabetes	Target variable: diabetes status (0 or 1)	Binary

Note: Some datasets might have slight variations in feature names or types.

🧹 Preprocessing Recommendations
Before modeling, consider the following preprocessing steps:

Handle missing values (e.g., impute or remove)

Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding)

Normalize/scale numerical values

Address class imbalance if present

🧪 Suggested Use Cases
Binary classification with logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks

Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix

Feature importance analysis to interpret predictive factors

📊 Sample Code (Python - pandas)
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv")

# Inspect data
print(df.head())
print(df.info())

# Example preprocessing
df['gender'] = df['gender'].map({'Male': 0, 'Female': 1, 'Other': 2})
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['smoking_history'], drop_first=True)
